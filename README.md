# No-code module to provision Niginix container on Docker
Simple use case to provision resources in Docker and outputs the container name. For simple demo purpose, this code uses the default port and randomly generate the name for the container. When using this module, if you create two containers in the same Docker desktop, you will run into the issue about conflict ports. Pls change the inputs accordingly.
